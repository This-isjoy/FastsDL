                    privacy seeker.<br />

                    <b>2. Use DND Mode</b><br />
                    The DND mode is ideal for those that would want to temporarily mute the receipt of messages but want
                    the phone for other
                    functions. This mode activated will prevent any message from being received on GB WhatsApp Pro until
                    the of is off.<br />
                    <b>3. Anti-Revoke Feature</b><br />
                    Yes, ever received a msg frm someone only for him/her to delete it before you read it. Anti-revoke
                    is one of the
                    features of GB WhatsApp Pro, which makes it compulsory even if the message was deleted, it remains
                    visible to the

                    no. For instance,
                    you can make your blue tick appear only when you respond to a specific message and make you have
                    more control over the
                    read receipt.

                <img src="../assets/images/gbwhatapp/Safe.webp" alt="Is-GB-WhatsApp-Pro-Safe" />

                <p class="description">
                    This is especially because of the always rising privacy concerns that most users have about the
                    application. It only has
                    a lot of cool features to provide, but it is not the official WhatsApp and there are some factors to
                    take a look before
                    installing the app.<br />

                    <b>&#8226; Potential Risks</b><br />

                    <b>1. Privacy Issues: </b>But because it is not an official application the question arises that
                    your data can be stolen.<br />
                    <b>2. Account Ban:</b>Akin to this, the official terms of service of WhatsApp does not allow the use
                    of third party applications such as GB
                    WhatsApp. It could lead to suspension of your WhatsApp account for a limited period or
                    indefinitely.<br />
                    <b>&#8226; Safety Tips</b><br />
                    1. It is prudent to download GB WhatsApp Pro only from authentic sources only.<br />
                    2. Make sure that your app is the latest version to avoid compromising on the bugs and security
                    issues.<br />
                    3. As much as GB WhatsApp Pro has the intended extra features, do not use it for official or
                    sensitive conversations and
                    instead use the official whatsapp application.<br />
                    <b>&#8226; Final Thoughts on Safety</b><br />
                    If you still want to use the GB WhatsApp Pro, then it is important that you must know the risks that
                    you’re exposing
                    yourself into. Nevertheless, one may consider using the official WhatsApp since the additional
                    options can too often
                    compromise data privacy.
