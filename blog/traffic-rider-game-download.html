                    However, to max out the fun and the results in Traffic Rider then it
                    is crucial to learn how to play the game properly despite the Mod
                    APK version.<br />
                    <b>&#8226; Here are some tips to help you master the game</b><br />
                    <b>1. Smart use of Nitro Boost</b><br />
                    Nitro is also another important component of the game since it
                    offers you a certain amount of speed boost to overtake others or
                    gain a lead to the finish line in a short span of time. Engage the
                    use of it when traversing straight routes that don’t have much
                    traffic, so that one does not have accidents.<br />
                    <b>2. Sustainability of speed in order to acquire more points.</b><br />
                    In Traffic Rider, the more you increase the speed the more the
                    points you gain. Though it ups the danger of crashing, so you should
                    be careful when you are using turbo boosts, use them where
                    appropriate like on highways.<br />
                    <b>3. Pass Traffic Closely </b><br />
                    Catching passing vehicles earns you extra points but it’s rather
                    dangerous. Timing is a key factor that you need to apply while
                    passing cars so that you do not end up knocking them down. Star
                    passes at high speeds increases your score.<br />
                    <b>4. Informant learning should not remain confined to learning
                        traffic patterns but also, learn how to weave through traffic.</b><br />
                    Navigation through traffic is the basic function in Traffic Rider.
                    Washington post should facilitate the readers with techniques on how
                    to maneuver through congested areas without stalling. This will
                    assist you to increase your overall speed and accumulating of
                    points.
